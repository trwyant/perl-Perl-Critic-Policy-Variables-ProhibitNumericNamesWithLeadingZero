README - This file.

var-names-with-leading-zero - This is a script that executes the
    ProhibitNumericNamesWithLeadingZero policy. It is more or less
    equivalent to
    $ perlcritic --single ProhibitNumericNamesWithLeadingZero
    but has its own configuration file. Use
    $ var-names-with-leading-zero --help
    for the documentation.
